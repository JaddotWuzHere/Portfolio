          Classical pianist, composer, and occasional producer. I write for full orchestra, solo piano,
          and make EDM on the side.

          <h3>Tinker's Toy Factory</h3>

          <p>
            A full orchestra piece I wrote for my high school orchestra. My orchestra teacher was inspired by Haydn's Toy Symphony 
            and wanted something similar for our orchestra to play, so she inquired me about it. At the time I was really into 
            steampunk aesthetics (still am now, just look at The Continuum), so I took on a very percussive approach to the piece.
          </p>

          <p>I ended up conducting this piece at the Big 9 Music Festival in Minnesota in front of a live audience. I'd imagine
            this to be one of my proudest moments in my music career.

          <h3>The Ghoul Down Elganwoode Street</h3>

          <p>
            This is a WIP solo piano piece that I'm working on. I took inspiration from a bit of 
            Chopin and Liszt to write a fast paced waltz. The piece tells a story during a dark, dimly lit London street. The 
            rest can be up to your vivid imagination.

          <h3>Snowburst</h3>

          <p>
            My latest EDM release. I initially wanted to release this on Christmas of 2023, I got a bit delayed and released it in February
            of 2024. I wanted to invoke a comfortable and lighthearted tone in this track, and also wanted to try my hand at producing future bass.

          <h3>Midnight Rave</h3>

          <p>
            I really enjoy electro swing, a genre of EDM that blends electronic elements with jazz. One of my favorite instruments is the alto sax, 
            and I wanted to incorporate it somehow into my tracks. I made this in three days just in time for Halloween.

          <h3>Hell Dance</h3>

          <p>
            Before drift phonk was plaguing every corner of TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels, I especially enjoyed listening to the genre 
            as it evoked a very strong feeling of confidence and excitement whenever I heard the 808 cowbells. I decided to try my hand at making such 
            a track after being inspired by The Raven by ATSMXN and XTOM.
